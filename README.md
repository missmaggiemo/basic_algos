I created this repo to store my implementations of common algorithms.

This repo includes:

* binary search

* deep duplication of an array

* recursive factorial

* recursive fibonacci

* merge sort

* bubble sort

* quick sort

* all subsets of an array

* Karger's algorithm [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karger's_algorithm)

* tree_node-- a folder with a node class and tree search algorithms
